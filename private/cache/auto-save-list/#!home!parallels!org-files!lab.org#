* TF Inference Project
** Visualizations
*** GViz
**** DONE Create general script to extract visualize specific genes of interest to look at
     CLOSED: [2019-07-18 Thu 15:53]
**** DONE Add TSS track and TF binding site track to visualizations
     CLOSED: [2019-07-18 Thu 15:48] SCHEDULED: <2019-07-18 Thu>
***** Added TSS track <2019-07-18 Thu>
***** Added TFBS track <2019-07-18 Thu>
**** ONHOLD Obtain list of genes that are not differentially expressed at gene level but are at TSS level
     1) Use sleuth to generate TSS-binding sites which are significantly differentially expressed
     2) Find subset of genes that do not overlap with DE genes from gene level aggregation
     3) Explore these regions of the genome
