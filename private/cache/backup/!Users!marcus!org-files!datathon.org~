** MED Will Loh
*** MIMIC3 Dataset
*** Predicitve monitoring for survival and neurological recovery of ICU patients
*** *What factors predict for good neurological outcome after severe head injury?*
** MED Benjamin Siu
***
*** MIMIC3 Dataset
*** Predicting mortality in pateints with acute respiratory distress
*** *Which patient is likely to have a worse of prognosis and is in greater need of care?*
*** *Classify patients into groups of varying "needs"*

*** MIMIC3 Dataset
*** Searching for an optimal blood pressure definition and range
*** *What are the optimal numbers for blood pressure?*
** LOW Cheng Yiling
*** Synthetic dataset
*** Would changeover months affect patient outcomes?
** MED Dr Vinod (DXC)
*** MIMIC3 Dataset

*** Kidney
*** Acute kidney injuries
*** *In an ICU setting, which patients can/need dialysis? Predict which patients to treat with this option?*
** MED Yau Ying Wei
*** MIMIC3 Dataset
*** Optimising blood pressure management in patients with acute haemorrhagic stroke
*** 20% of patients are independent after a stroke, most become dependent on chronic care after coming out of the hospital
*** *Blood pressure control -> How does this affect the prognosis? Is it important? Maybe this doesn't really affect prognosis at all*
** LOW Norris Ling
*** MIMIC3 + Synthetic dataset
*** Longtitudinal trends of high risk asthma
*** *?? What is the problem statement really*
** HIGH Chia Po Ying
*** MIMIC dataset
*** Predictive model for vetilated ICU patients who develop ventilator-assocaited complications
*** *Patient outcomes from ventilation*
** HIGH Mark/Mayank
*** BYOD dataset
*** Deep-learning algorithm for decision making on short-term vs long-term DAPT after PCI
*** Blood thinners put patients at risk of bleeding and so what is the optimal duration to put patients on thinners
*** *Optimal duration for patients to be on two blood thinners (?) after stent insertion*
** LOW Bryce/Caroline Tee
*** Synthetic dataset
*** Role of drug-drug interactions in reactive airway disease and ARDS
*** Asthma patients
** MED Byorn
*** Synthetic dataset
*** Effects of mild AKI on long-term renal and cardiovascular outcomes - subset to look at post-surgical AKI
*** AKI -> kidney stuff
*** AKI -> Kidney disease implication
** HIGH Kewin Seah
*** Gastroenteritis
*** "No one should die from shitting" - haha
*** *Can we get a risk score for gastoenteritis*

   CLOSED: [2019-07-19 Fri 22:11]
*** Synthetic dataset

*** 19% of the elderly patients get readmitted within 30 days
*** LACE
**** Length of stay
**** Admissions
**** C (??)
**** Emergency presentation
** HIGH Jonie Sua
*** Synthetic dataset
*** What do I call my consultant?
*** Prediction of night-shift patient deterioration
*** *Create a predictive model to determine if a patient is going to get worse through the night*
** LOW Jacob Jeon
*** MIMIC-CXR dataset
*** Chest CXR Image
*** Automatic detection of chest XR data
** HIGH Shreshth Saini
*** ISIC dataset
*** Skin melanoma image analysis
** HIGH Ng Dianwen
*** Siims Acr
*** Pneumothorax dataset
*** Identify and segment pneumothorax for chest x-ray images
*** Pneumothorax -> call a doctor!
*** Can we detect this early and benefit patient management
* Prediction of remissions back into the ER
** Information, background and brainstorming
*** Use non-black box models such as neural networks or even ensembl methods for the matter so as to improve explainability of the model in order to make the project viable in a clinical setting
*** Stages of production
**** Data analysis -> what kinds of data do we have right now and can we split the patients into sub-populations (EDA)
**** Remission within 30 days -> yes/no
**** Remission within n days -> yes/no
***** Can we plot a graph of accuracy over time, ie show for how far into the future can we accurately predict
**** Days to remission -> continuous variable or categories (10/20/30/40/50/60 etc)
*** Models to consider
**** Stacking models?
**** Have a classifier on top to first separate the patients into sub-group
***** Elderly
***** Middle-aged
***** Young
***** Paedeatric
