* Principles
** Abstraction Barrier
*** An abstraction barrier is a barrier that exists between *implementer* and *client*.
*** This barrier *DOES NOT EXIST* on the implementer side. ie an Object can modify the attributes of another instance of the same class even if its marked as private
** Liskov Substitution Principle
** Single Responsiblity Principle
** Open-Closed Principle
** Interface Segregation Principle
** Dependency Inversion Principle
