* TF Inference Project
** GViz
*** DONE Create general script to extract visualize specific genes of interest to look at
    CLOSED: [2019-07-18 Thu 15:53]
*** DONE Add TSS track and TF binding site track to visualizations
     CLOSED: [2019-07-18 Thu 15:48] SCHEDULED: <2019-07-18 Thu>
***** Added TSS track <2019-07-18 Thu>
***** Added TFBS track <2019-07-18 Thu>
*** ONHOLD Obtain list of genes that are not differentially expressed at gene level but are at TSS level
    1) Use sleuth to generate TSS-binding sites which are significantly differentially expressed
    2) Find subset of genes that do not overlap with DE genes from gene level aggregation
       1) Explore these regions of the genome
** Volcano plots
*** Create volcano plots plotting -logFC (calculated using transformed wald-test values) against p-values with ability to highlight data points based on transcription factors/genes, etc
** Genomes and AI Conference
   SCHEDULED: <2019-10-02 Wed>
*** Poster submission
    DEADLINE: <2019-09-10 Tue>
** Alternative DEG analysis
*** DESeq2 DEG on SMAD3 (TGFb) and RUNX1 datasets
    SCHEDULED: <2019-08-22 Thu>
