** Is there a difference between open reading frame and coding sequences?
*** Yes in the sense that some predicted ORFs may not be real coding sequences.
*** ORF is a general description of a long stretch of nucleotides when translated looks like a protein sequence.
*** Can be real of course
** Am I right to say that ORF may contain introns?
*** If you try for yourself to do the exercise of translating an exon and into the introns, you may see that there may be an ORF even in the intron.
*** However, this may not be found in the real protein sequence.
*** Strange? Not really as the cells can splice out the intron and so this potential ORG is not found in the final protein sequence.
** As for now, I do not understand why we are predicting ORF from genomic sequences when they may be spurious ORFs or contains introns etc. Are there no better methods to look for protein-coding genes?
*** Other than signposting methods mentioned during lecture such as promoters and general transcription factors, can the start codon ATG be used to identify ORF?
*** The ORF search is something we can do with supercomputers and so now we need to validate experimentally.
*** Otherwise, purifying proteins will cost too much time and money.
*** Easier to go the reverse - see if we can experimentally validate the predicted sequences.
*** Yes, we can use ATG to map but ATG can also be internal to the protein sequence.
*** Anything and all things help to make sense of the sequences
